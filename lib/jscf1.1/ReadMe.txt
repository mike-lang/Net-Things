Javascript Collections Framework
This library mocks the Java's collection framework library.


Classes Available:
ArrayList
HashMap
HashSet
TreeMap
TreeSet
LinkedHashMap
LinkedHashSet

Usage:
The following three files should be included in the same order as below

base.js
CollectionInterfaces.js
AbstractCollections.js

Next depending on the usage any <collection>.js file can be included
and used.
Note: Some <collection>.js files have dependencies on other files
as well. e.g. HashSet needs HashMap to be included before using.

mail me @ khanrocks@gmail.com if you have any doubts. You can refer to Java's
documentation on the above collection classes. You will fiond all the methods
with few exceptions.

Happy Coding...
